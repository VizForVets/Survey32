## SITUATION

Survey 32 was a survey conducted in 1943 that was aimed at gauging the opinions and beliefs of soldiers. There were two surveys conducted: One for African American soldiers and one for white soldiers.

Find out more [here](https://catalog.archives.gov/id/854569) about this particular survey.

## MISSION

The challenge is to visualize any trend or story in the data that needs to be told in a clear and compelling way. 

## EXECUTION

The source data is located in this repository.

For your convenience, prepped data is located [here](https://github.com/VizForVets/Survey32/tree/main/Prepped%20Data). The prepped data includes both surveys as separate CSVs with a table linking apparent similar questions between the surveys. This is in by no means determinative and only provided as a way to compare the datasets. Obviously, you are free to prep the raw data yourself and compare questions as necessary.

Additionally, here is a short video of how I went about prepping the data in [Power Query](https://youtu.be/rmwVOAiA3R4).

You can use any tools at your disposal. The final product should be published as a dashboard to Tableau Public with the following hashtag in the details:
